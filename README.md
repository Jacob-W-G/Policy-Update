# Policy-Update


Updated the policy and made a test policy to see if a change could be used in the policys.

Started with a standard policy that needed a reboot due to a issue with parts that didnt work correctly in the policy.

This change requested after 35 minutes being inactive you would get logged out.

After roughly 20 minutes I had found what the policy update requested.

Once the change has been made a test policy was made to see if the policy change worked.

After the test policy was created it was put to the test but instead of 35 minutes it was made 2 minutes just to find out if these changes worked.

After the time was spent the policy test unfortunely failed but will be tested further in the future.
